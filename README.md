# WARNING: Moving do Devstronomy GitHub
All code related to the Devstronomy development is being migrated to the
[Devstronomy GitHub](https://github.com/devstronomy).

Instead of having one monolithic repository here, there will be a set of individual repositories for frontend, backend,
tooling, and GitHub pages. This repository will be empty, containing an explanation of migration with links to the
Devstronomy GitHub. 

### Already migrated
