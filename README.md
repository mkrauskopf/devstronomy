# NOTE: Moved do Devstronomy GitHub
Everything related to the Devstronomy development was migrated to [Devstronomy GitHub](https://github.com/devstronomy).

Instead of having one monolithic repository here, there is now a set of individual repositories for frontend, backend,
tooling, and GitHub pages. This repository is now empty, containing an explanation of migration with links to the
[Devstronomy GitHub](https://github.com/devstronomy).
